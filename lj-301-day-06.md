# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 06

Way better day today. Lecture was super helpful, without a doubt the best day of 301 so far. I had a pretty good understanding of MVC beforehand, but it was helpful to have the diagram written out in front of me with the different protocols in the right places. But the AJAX/JSON bit was so much more simple than it seemed from the readings, and it felt like it unlocked whole worlds of data to play with. Finally feels like we're getting into consequential development here and I'm looking forward to getting deeper into it this week.
