#Learning Journal Day 06

Today was a challenge. I was able to figure out how to build a function to create random numbers within a band and push that to an array -- after 30 minutes of staring at it, only to discover I had a > where there should've been a <. But it took time to figure out how to turn that function into a method. Once I figured that out, it wasn't terribly difficult to make the 'cookies per hour' method.

From that point, it was a strain to make the DOM manipulation work and it took both input from my colleagues as well as just plugging in stuff from the textbook for trial and error to make it function properly. But I got it to work as a function and it displays properly. Now on to styling.

After I headed home and had dinner I came back to the styling portion. I'm finding it difficult to access the creativity necessary to style something beautiful. It just looks chunky and off somehow. I don't notice a lot of websites that are just multicolored blocks of text, so I obviously don't have the right tools yet or else I'm not able to put them together very well. It's a little discouraging, in a way, because while if I were to work for a company they would have designers to give me design specs, if I freelance then the design portion is a huge part of what I'm selling. Have to get better!
