# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 08

Great day, great lab. I feel like we're finally getting into the guts of the internet and I have a way better understanding of how client/server/db interact. Feeling pretty strong right now, and the lab really helped crystalize some things, like exactly what a query ***is*** -- and it's not necessarily a question, it's often a command. That was a helpful realization. Sam also sat down with us to show us what the db is sending back to the server when it gets an UPDATE query that requires no real result, which was also helpful.

I also really appreciate the course correction Sam made in class yesterday regarding interruptions and digressions. We'll see how long the rubber duck lasts, but it really did help things to keep on track and run more smoothly. The big digression today, regarding when and how you need to do package installs on code you're creating versus code you're just working with -- was extremely helpful and a big clarification from yesterday. Good teaching!
