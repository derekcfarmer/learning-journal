# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 03

Day 02 was pretty decent. Lab didn't take too long, Dustin and I knocked it out pretty quickly. I did a lot of jQuery reading before class, so I feel well-prepared for the week's focus. Same goes for Day 03, although lab took longer than I'd have liked -- about four hours. Oscar and I are a good team and I enjoy working with him. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to properly concatenate an attribute selector, but once we had that figured out the rest of the lab went quickly.

My portfolio isn't coming along as quickly as I'd like -- I just don't quite have a vision yet for what I want it to look like, so I'm more or less building it out slowly to meet the requirements while I work out a wireframe vision. I'd like for it to have three or maybe four different CSS styles that can change dynamically with a button click, but that means I have to be very particular at the beginning about how I lay things out lest I regret it later.
