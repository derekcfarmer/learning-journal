# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 10

Really challenging lab, but I'm really glad to have finally arrived at higher order functions and I definitely feel like I understand the lab well. It's too bad we didn't have time to go over arrow functions in class, but having to figure out the notation myself was helpful and I think I get it. It's strange, I saw this stuff over and over in Eloquent JS and in CodeWars but it just didn't make sense. I realize now the issue is that the syntax wasn't making sense for the callback functions -- where was the argument coming from and what did the it mean? Now I realize that you just have to know that .map() takes as its argument each element of the array it's called on. If you don't know that there's no way to glean the information by looking at the expression. It's sort of the first thing we've done that's not readable in this way.
