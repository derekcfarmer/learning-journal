#Learning Journal Day 07 - CF 201

Today clicked for some reason. Meaghan's code review really helped drop a few things into place, and she had a couple solutions that were a lot more DRY than the ones I had come up with. There were also a few things, like having open/close hours as properties of the store object as opposed to values in a separate array, that wouldn't make a difference to our project now but would be better in the real world because they would be easier to have a user change. I'll try to incorporate those by the end of the week.

Writing the object constructor was far more straightforward than creating five object literals, and the task wasn't difficult. Pulling together the table took more doing, but drawing it out beforehand helped a lot. I picked up some dry erase markers yesterday so I could sketch on my table and it helped immensely. Figuring out how to make the columns total was a challenge, but I was pretty pleased to have figured it out. Ditto the second table for staff hours. There are a few things that could be more elegant so that they wouldn't have to be manually changed if another store opened, for example, but I'll try to fix those tomorrow. For now, it all works.
