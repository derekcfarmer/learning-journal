#Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 17

A little bit more frustrating today. I think John and I have really torn it up, and I have to say we've impressed ourselves. I think we both thought that the feature we elected to code was just building a bunch of boxes to put on the screen, but it ended up requiring us to design the engine of the whole app -- the piece that compares objects and displays them.

The frustrating bit has been team communication today. Nothing major, but there were a few issues where we were at cross purposes because we misunderstood how each others' code worked and what we needed to accomplish our goals. We're also missing a critical piece that we need to get to MVP, and that has raised the tensions a little bit as we struggle to put it together.
