# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 11

Coder's Log: Earthdate 20170522;

Not a bad day. I quit smoking two days ago and I'm really freaking loopy, with tons of nervous energy and it was hard to concentrate on anything today. MVC is cool. Went to a meetup. I think I understand all the things we've learned to the level we're supposed to have learned them. Feeling good about things. 

Birthday tomorrow. Never thought I would be so old. So very old.
