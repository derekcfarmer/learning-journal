#Learning Journal CF 201 Day 08

Complicated day. I had a difficult time with the JavaScript readings last night and as a result I struggled with the lecture today. I felt like I looked down to address and error in the code I was copying for a minute or two and when I looked up I was lost. After that I had to just close my computer and try to follow along, but it was a bit too swift to follow. That made the lab quite difficult, but ultimately I worked through it and have a pretty good sense of, at least, how to write an eventListener and trigger a function from an event.

I'm not feeling great about my lab submission today. While I have a form that looks okay and works for the first submission, subsequent submissions cause miscalculations in the arrays leading to incorrect data displayed on the tables. It makes me question the entire logic of how I put the project together, but I'm not entirely sure how I'd do it differently. Hopefully things will become clearer with time.
