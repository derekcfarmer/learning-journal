# Learning Journal - 201 Day 10

I found lecture to be helpful today, basically reviewing the week by coding the project on the fly. It helped solidify things quite a bit. I'm finding myself settling into the rhythm of the course and enjoying the labwork quite a bit. Today in particular I enjoyed the CSS lab challenge, both working with Josh and Alexis and the satisfaction of making a webpage the looks passably professional. I'm glad it turned out so well because I was getting frustrated with the CSS styling of my cookie shop project page, mostly because I created conflicts by using px in some places and % in others, so the page looks fine on my 13" screen but poor when I resize the window. This was starting to worry me a bit because I have always suspected that web design is something I'll end up doing for a while and I was beginning to wonder if I was going to be any good at it. Progress!
