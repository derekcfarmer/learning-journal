# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 18

Great day. Really felt like we were jamming out the code, things were working as intended and it seemed like we are gelling as a team. Last night I was feeling anxious about getting styling done and it was a little demoralizing not having anything to look at -- just black text on a screen. So I spent a few hours in the evening styling the app and I have to say it looks pretty darn good. Looks like a gamer site, if I do say so myself. Having finished the results display engine, today John and I spent the bulk of the day styling the results page and its starting to come together. Looking forward to tomorrow.
