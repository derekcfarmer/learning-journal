# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 14

Today was a solid day. I spent a bunch of time refactoring my busmall code and I really feel like it paid off. I was finally able to figure out why I was having trouble combinging my event handlers into one bit of code - it was an issue with event.target. My event listener was looking for clicks on a div called imgX which contained the image, but event.target was actually the image itself. By changing it to event.currentTarget I could capture the div rather than the image. That was a solid lesson.

I also had a very frustrating time because after figuring all that out my program was breaking in an endless loop and I couldn't figure out why. I'm still not 100% sure why, but it was fixed by clearing localStorage. I had reduced the program iterations to one play-through for testing purposes, and when I increased it back to 25 it broke something. It must've had something to do with pulling a too-small array from localStorage every time, but I'm still not exactyl sure why.
