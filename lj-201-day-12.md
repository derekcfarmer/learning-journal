# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 12

Today things looked up a bit. The assignment was easier -- I could honestly just follow the documentation in Chart.js and make the chart work as I wanted it to. But I did spend about 90 minutes helping Matthew figure out his event handler and debug some of his code, which made me feel smart again and allowed us to connect a bit to boot. I was honestly glad to see other people had problems with yesterdays project as well -- I felt really dumb at the end of class, and felt like I was the only one not getting it. It was good to see that wasn't the case.

Even two weeks in it's starting to feel like things are taking shape in terms of a future career. I still feel like I'm on a somewhat different path than most of my peers -- not a different feeling for me -- but I'm starting to see how it all fits together and can envision a future for myself in this industry. Some of the mystique is starting to fade, in a good way. It's getting less scary.
