# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 11

One of the most frustrating days so far. I spent literally nine hours working on this assignment and couldn't figure out some critical things. I ended up making it work, mostly, but figuring out how to keep the same image from displaying twice (or three times) on the same screen was maddening. I eventually settled on a three-variable cycle, where the first random number was used to pull and image, then that random number was pushed to variable number two. Then a second random number was chosen and used to pull an image (so long as it wasn't the same as variable number two). Then var two was pushed to var three, and var one to var two, etc etc. In that way I could make sure the same image wasn't diplayed more than once on the same page.

For the requirement that images not be displayed on two consecutive choice-flights, I first came up with a scheme to have a boolean operator called lastChosen to make sure that X wasn't on the previous slate of choices. But if I flipped that X to false at the end of the eventhandler, then there was a possiblity that Y would be chosen. So I came up with a cycle of three to prevent that from happening. It works almost all of the time, but because the cycle resets after the third iteration, there is a non-zero chance that one of the third grouping of photos will be selected in group number four. I still need to work on that.

Overall, this was probably the worst day so far. I was hungry, frustrated, and angry by the end of the day and I was not a fun person to be around. I felt really great on Friday after the CSS challenge, but today I feel really stupid.
