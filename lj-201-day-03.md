# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Well, today was a bit more challenging. Loops can be confusing to me. I was able to implement a for loop to get to MVP, but I didn't use any while or while do loops. I suspect there was a more elegant solution to the guessing game (Q 7) that didn't require a for loop for every user submission, but I couldn't figure it out. If I could figure out how to determine whether a string is included in an array it would've been easy, but I couldn't find a straightforward way to do that.

Github was also a bit of a pain today, because I had already opened a new repo and had to figure out how to move that code back to a new branch of yesterday's repo. It was both irritating and nerve-wracking. It felt like I was fighting my way through a flurry of nearly-identical papers, only one of which was the right one and with a high potential for accidentally deleting the one I wanted. All ended up well, but I'll definitely ask for clarification in the future if I'm not sure whether it should be a new branch or new repo.

I realize I need to start paying more attention to design issues on the web so I have a better palette for web design. Right now my toolkit for making webpages look good is pretty limited, and so many of these decisions are aesthetic -- like how much margin and padding looks good. It's very open to feel and preference. I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, but I'm having to get used to the units and proportions involved. What does 40px look like? How about 80px? Does it look different on different sized screens? Should I be using em's or % of screenspace to account for different screen sizes? Lots of design questions.
