# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 15

Today was actually pretty frustrating. I just wasn't in the right mindset for group work, I guess. I felt like I really blew my project pitch -- it was obvious from the get go that nobody else was interested in my problem set, which was frustrating because it was a real and discreet problem that hounded me for two years at my previous job and which we could actually help address with the coding skills we currently have. Instead I'm going to be working on a gamer-related project that I really have no interest in. But I suppose in a job I may not always care deeply about the project I'm working on (although that's very much my goal), and I shouldn't let that affect how I interact with my teammates.

Regardless, I can't say I'm super excited to spend next week working on this project. I hope we're able to divide up the work effectively and navigate conflicts well, both git merge and inter-personal.
