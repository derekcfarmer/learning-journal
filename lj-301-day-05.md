# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 05

Probably the most frustrating day of CF so far. The tone was set by a really obnoxious ad from CF on a metro bus and a poorly worded response from the CEO that was picked up on geekwire and then KIRO radio here in Seattle. Frustrating because more people in the area will hear that radio program than have ever even heard of CF before. A lot of my friends are active in affordable housing policy in the city, and honestly I'm embarrassed by the ad. I understand the intent of the ad and I know how much focus the leadership is putting on assisting women, minorities, veterans, and people who are underrepresented in the industry -- myself included -- but I really am sensitive to how much the tech industry here is hated by a large swath of the community and conflicted about the tech industry's role in raising rents and property values and thereby forcing longtime residents of the city out to Federal Way and Tacoma.

As for the class itself, it seems to me that the class is divided in two groups. A small group of students who can't keep themselves from speaking every thought and frustration out loud and a larger group who is frustrated at how much time is wasted catering to the first group. This came to a head today when we took half an hour to solve a problem that didn't exist -- one student simply wasn't paying attention and her code 'looked different'. So we stopped to solve the problem, only to realize that she just hadn't been keeping up with changes made on the screen and a few other people were in the same boat. Had this happened in 201, Duncan would've just said "if you can't keep up, close you lid and follow along on the screen and you can get the code after class if you want it" but Sam allowed the class to be sidetracked for half an hour.

This has gone on all week, and is only getting worse. I've talked to my other friends in class and we're all of one mind in feeling like we're missing out on material that we're supposed to -- and need to -- be learning. We have X material to learn and Y days to do it, and every distraction, every tangent, every funny joke and animal meme, every story about Microsoft of frustration about how you 'just didn't get it yesterday', every time the class explodes into individual conversations just because Sam has to pause, it all takes away from the limited time we have to be exposed to this material in a classroom setting. 14 weeks from now we're all going to be looking for jobs. This is supposed to be a bootcamp -- in the lecture maybe you get it or maybe you don't, but the train has to keep moving and you can get it later on.

I'm putting all that into weekly feedback as well.
