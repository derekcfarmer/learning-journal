#Learning Journal 201 - Day 09

An okay day. I quickly figured out the couple of bugs that were causing me problems in my table rendering. Turns out that input passed in from the user was being created as a string instead of a number, despite the html tag calling out the input as a number. That was causing problems as strings were appended to the array and being added together, so a quick parseInt() fixed the issue. I also learned that parseFloat() will turn a string to a decimal. I did not, however, find a good way to refactor my array of hours into a set of properties on my object constructor because of the way all my for loops were written. I could make it work, but not in a way that would allow you to update the hours for an individual store and make them different than the others. Another thing I couldn't figure out was how to validate an input for the store name to make sure it wasn't identical to another. Now, unfortunately, if you enter an identical store name it will append that store's data to the right side of the table under the same row as the same-named store.

The big frustration was CSS. I spent a lot of time getting my page styled in a decent way, only to realize that changing the screen size moved everything across the page in a way I hadn't predicted. I'll have to analyze why all that happened and figure out how to fix it.
