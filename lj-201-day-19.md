# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 19

Catastrophe strikes. Most frustrating day to date. We had a merge this morning and despite having few conflicts, everything broke and we were getting different errors on different computers. The day just got worse from there. John and I got the remainder of the styling pretty much done, only to realize that the form looked completely different on different resolutions sending me back to the drawing board. I realized, only after re-styling all the elements in absolute positions, that because we didn't wireframe the form before coding it everything was nested poorly and the absolutes still looked different on different computers and I'd have to redo the underlying code to fix it. No time for that, so I'll just have to make it look good on the projector and make it look right after we get our first infusion of venture capital.

The bigger challenge was that just before run-through I realized our underlying conditional logic wasn't working properly. It took John and me hours and hours to work through the problem and fix the logic, only to realize it exposed an underlying error in Oscar's code that we couldn't have known about. We beat our heads against the wall for a while and I eventually went to bed. Luckily, I came in this morning and saw the error in 30 seconds and fixed it with one line of code. Problem solved, presentation ready.
