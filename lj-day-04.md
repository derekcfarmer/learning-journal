# learning-journal-Day-04

Today we tackled layout and functions. I felt I already had a pretty good grip on functions, but man, I had so much trouble with layout when I was doing the Code Academy projects. In particular, I was confused about block versus inline versus block-inline, and about float and clear-fix. Ultimately I felt really good about how the layout lecture turned out, and I'm confident I have a much better grasp on the concepts. I was able to divide the screen in half and half again and half again, using floats and clear-fixes.

Beyond that, it was kind of a doing day. Our first pair programming went pretty well, Dustin and I were able to puzzle through things well. Yet again it was github flubs that occupied the most time, but that's how I learn, I guess. The other issue, as I said in my submission, was that I had commented out a } from window.onload and that broke everything. I had written a really elegant function that would've worked for Q1-Q5, but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working and had to go back to zero to figure it out. When we finally figured out the } issue we had already put each Q into its own function. Bummer. But at least we won't make that error again... right?
