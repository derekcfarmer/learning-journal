# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today started off with a code review from TJ's first lab. While I felt like I took something away, we haven't yet gotten beyond the knowledge I gained from doing the pre-work. I spent a fair amount of time a couple of months ago going through Code Academy's modules and thus far the instruction has all been review.

Git and Github are new to me in practice, although I understood it conceptually from the pre-work and Code Academy Git module. It was good to get some quick experience with Add/Commit/Push in the lecture before we had to do it in lab. I'm still not entirely certain I understand why those are three separate steps. Why does git require 'adding' a file? What is gained?

The lab was pretty straightforward, and I'm fairly confident I met the requirements. The app works well and reliably for any combination of yes/no and y/n. I wasn't feeling very frivolous or amusing today, so my questions and answers are pretty straightforward but you'd definitely learn something about me by going through the exercise. I wasn't 100% sure what the 'About Me' text should've been, or whether I was supposed to use that 'user story' for the text, so I just started a short resume since I know that's something that'll come in handy in the near future.

Starting to get my tools and conventions down so that they're maximally useful. I always feel good when I'm organized and my data is tidy. A place for everything...

Looking forward to tomorrow!
