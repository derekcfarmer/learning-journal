# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 01

Excited to be back at school learning code. Today was pretty slow -- I really felt like there were a lot of things that could've been sped through, like explaining learning journals, for example. Since all of us have been through 201 it seems like we could've really jumped over a lot of what we covered today. For those that hadn't been in 201 (if there were any), these things could've been part of pre-work for them, or they could've come in for a half day last week. I don't want to seem frustrated but we only have 20 days and it doesn't feel like I learned anything today.

The lab was pretty simple, Tim and I tore through it pretty fast. But I'm excited that there are more assignments this class, and more extra credit, and I'm looking forward to ripping into Code Wars. It plays to that eagerness to earn merit badges that I, and I suspect many would-be coders, have.

Looking forward to tomorrow!
