# Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 13

A pretty good day. I hadn't finished the readings as of this morning so I was a little lost in lecture when Dunc was talking about local storage. I was having a difficult time focusing as well, and so I was a bit worried about whether or not I'd be able to get my busmall program to send things to localStorage without a ton of self study and watching the lecture video over again. Luckily Adan, who has done this project before, had written his code so that it was functional although imperfect and together we figured out how to improve it. Once we figured it out it was actually very simple to implement.
