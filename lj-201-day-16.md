#Learning Journal - CF 201 - Day 16

Pretty good day. I was very pleased at the progress John and I made toward our goals through pair programming. I was very skeptical of the pair programming process at first, but it's proved to be very productive. There have been many moments where I'm sure I'd have stared at the same problem for a long time were I working alone, but together we managed to talk through the problem and come up with a viable solution.

It's also been quite a bit of fun to wireframe out a whole web app and work as a team to complete a project. I don't think I ever quite fully understood how different features get divvied up among collaborators and how it all comes together, but it's starting to get more clear. I'm very impressed by the progress we made working as a team and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
