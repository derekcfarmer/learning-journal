# Learning Journal - CF 301 - Day 15

Pretty hectic day between review lecture, quick lunch, power hour and the start of project week. Feeling pretty anxious about getting a solid product out there by the end of the week, particularly since we're down a day on Monday and me going out of town Saturday and Sunday for my anniversary.

I think we got a pretty good plan in place for the app, which we're calling Helios. It's a little different from my vision of a pre-industrial clock, but it will be more functional. So far I'm very pleased with how our group is gelling -- I was apprehensive about how some of our personalities were going to mesh, but it's been a pretty good relationship so far, after one day. We'll see how things hold up when I start to get more tense. I want this to be a solid project that we can be proud of, so I really hope we can pull it together in three days!
